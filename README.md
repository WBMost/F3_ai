### Autonomous Gameplay with Artificial Intelligence in Fallout 3
This project is an ambitious undertaking that leverages the capabilities of AI to autonomously engage in gameplay within the video game world of Fallout 3. This project represents a convergence of sophisticated proprietary AI algorithms, computer vision technologies, and natural language processing techniques, all meticulously designed to achieve a semi-human level of gameplay proficiency. Furthermore, the datasets being custom created using game captures that effectively trained and molded the neural network through several iterations further improving the computer vision detections resulting in improved gameplay.

## Where are the datasets?
The datasets can't be added into this repo as its over 10,000+ jpgs of game captures showing just NPCs in game. There will be even more data for just about every major classification of "thing" the AI could see to be able to classify everything with as high of an accuracy as possible. This is the most complicated part as all images used for these datasets are from me having to play and screen capture everything thousands of times over.

## What kind of Neural Network is this?
This is a neural network built from the ground up using PyTorch that is structured similarly to ResNet but is a lot more simple and specifically made for Fallout 3. There are future plans to try and integrate this over to other games but for now it is enclosed to play vanilla Fallout 3. Future games entail more from the Bethesda archives as they're one of my favorite publishers. (Dark Souls Seems like it could be fun though to try and detect attack patterns)

## Why Fallout 3?
Fallout 3 seemed like one of the best options for a 3D game that an AI could play as aiming is not a strong focus due to the existence of the in game VATs system so earlier iterations of the aiming features can be placed on the back burner with the current major focus being on world and dialogue navigation. 

# TLDR
In summary, the "Autonomous Gameplay with Artificial Intelligence in Fallout 3" project represents a pioneering fusion of AI and gaming, showcasing the potential for AI to undertake autonomous gameplay in complex virtual environments. This endeavor pushes the boundaries of AI technology, offering an intriguing glimpse into the future of AI-driven gaming experiences.
